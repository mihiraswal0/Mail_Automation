# Mail_Automation
This project was a part of an assessment for Backend Internship by listed. In this project I devloped a Node.js based app that is able to respond to emails sent to our Gmail mailbox while weâ€™re out on a vacation. 

## Features
1. Login using Google [http://localhost:8000/api/google/login](http://localhost:8000/api/google/login)
2. Automatic replies to all the unread messages receiving for the first time. [http://localhost:8000/api/mailReply](http://localhost:8000/api/mailReply)
3. Automatically add labels to the replied messages .
4. Repeatdly check for unread messages after a certain period of time.
5. Logout using Google [http://localhost:8000/api/google/logout](http://localhost:8000/api/google/logout)

### Technologies

2. Framework: Express js
3. Dependencies: express, axios, google-auth,
